# SiteSentinel Architecture Review-1

## Sprint

Sprint 1 Closure

## Result

APPROVED

## Product Owner

Approved

## Architecture Status

Core Assessment Lifecycle Implemented

## Implementation Status

Sprint 0 established the approved architecture baseline.

Sprint 1 implemented the first working version of the SiteSentinel core assessment lifecycle.

The implemented lifecycle is:

Website
↓
MonitoringRun
↓
HTTP Evidence Collection
↓
CollectedEvidence
↓
NormalizedEvidence
↓
Finding
↓
Risk
↓
TrustAssessment

## Sprint 1 Completion Notes

Sprint 1 completed the following architecture-aligned implementation areas:

- Website registration baseline
- Monitoring run execution lifecycle
- Real HTTP evidence collection
- Evidence normalization
- Finding generation
- Risk evaluation
- Trust assessment generation
- Traceability across evidence, findings, risks, and trust assessments
- Scanner configuration
- Scanner target safety guardrails
- Dashboard and detail page visibility
- Assessment outcome clarity

## Preserved Architecture Boundaries

- Evidence Collection Engine collects evidence only.
- Evidence Analysis Engine normalizes evidence and produces findings.
- Risk Evaluation Engine produces risks from findings.
- Trust Evaluation Engine produces trust assessments from risks.
- Raw evidence does not directly produce risk or trust decisions.

## Ready for Sprint 2

The project is ready to move to Sprint 2.

Sprint 2 should extend the implemented lifecycle without replacing the Sprint 1 foundation.

# SiteSentinel Architecture Review-2

## Sprint

Sprint 2 Closure

## Result

APPROVED

## Product Owner

Approved

## Architecture Status

Core Assessment Lifecycle Implemented  
Explainable Traceability Layer Implemented

## Implementation Status

Sprint 0 established the approved architecture baseline.

Sprint 1 implemented the first working version of the SiteSentinel core assessment lifecycle.

Sprint 2 implemented the explainable traceability review layer across the persisted assessment lifecycle.

The implemented lifecycle is:

Website

MonitoringRun
↓
HTTP Evidence Collection
↓
CollectedEvidence
↓
NormalizedEvidence
↓
Finding
↓
Risk

TrustAssessment

The implemented traceability review layer exposes:

## Sprint 2 Completion Notes

Sprint 2 completed the following architecture-aligned implementation areas:

- Finding detail traceability
- Normalized evidence detail traceability
- Collected evidence detail traceability
- Risk detail traceability
- Trust assessment detail traceability
- Traceability navigation between lifecycle outputs
- Monitoring run traceability summary dashboard
- Overall traceability QA status
- Coverage status labels for lifecycle traceability paths
- Same-page traceability review anchors

## Preserved Architecture Boundaries

- Evidence Collection Engine collects evidence only.
- Evidence Analysis Engine normalizes evidence and produces findings.
- Risk Evaluation Engine produces risks from findings.
- Trust Evaluation Engine produces trust assessments from risks.
- Traceability views expose persisted relationships only.
- Traceability views do not reinterpret evidence, findings, risks, or trust assessments.
- Raw evidence does not directly produce risk or trust decisions.

## Ready for Sprint 3

The project is ready to move to Sprint 3.

Sprint 3 should extend the implemented lifecycle and traceability foundation without replacing the 
Sprint 1 or Sprint 2 architecture baseline.

## Sprint 3 Architecture Review — Assessment History & Change Comparison Baseline

### Review Status

Approved.

Sprint 3 is complete.

### Scope Reviewed

Sprint 3 introduced a read-only historical comparison layer for completed monitoring runs.

The implemented comparison layer compares:

- Current completed monitoring run.
- Previous completed monitoring run for the same website.
- Trust assessment output.
- Finding output grouped by finding type.
- Risk output grouped by risk type.

### Architecture Assessment

The implementation is consistent with the SiteSentinel architecture.

Sprint 3 correctly builds on:

- Sprint 1 lifecycle execution.
- Sprint 2 traceability review layer.

The comparison layer does not replace or duplicate lifecycle responsibilities.

### Approved Architecture Boundaries

The Sprint 3 comparison layer is approved as a read-oriented layer.

It may:

- Read monitoring runs.
- Read trust assessments.
- Read findings.
- Read risks.
- Compare persisted outputs.
- Display comparison summaries.
- Link back to traceability pages.

It must not:

- Collect evidence.
- Normalize evidence.
- Generate findings.
- Evaluate risks.
- Generate trust assessments.
- Modify historical assessment outputs.
- Reinterpret raw evidence outside the approved lifecycle engines.

### Baseline Selection Rule

Only completed monitoring runs are valid comparison candidates.

Pending, running, failed, or incomplete monitoring runs must not be used as the previous 
comparison baseline.

### UI Review

The following UI surfaces are approved:

- Full monitoring run comparison page.
- Monitoring run detail link to comparison page.
- Website detail latest comparison summary.
- Traceability links from comparison output back to existing detail pages.

### Result

Sprint 3 is approved and may be marked complete.

The project is ready to move toward scheduled monitoring, reporting, or notification 
features in later sprints.
