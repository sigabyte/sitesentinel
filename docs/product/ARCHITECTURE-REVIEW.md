# SiteSentinel Architecture Review-1

## Sprint

Sprint 1 Closure

## Result

APPROVED

## Product Owner

Approved

## Architecture Status

Core Assessment Lifecycle Implemented

## Implementation Status

Sprint 0 established the approved architecture baseline.

Sprint 1 implemented the first working version of the SiteSentinel core assessment lifecycle.

The implemented lifecycle is:

Website
↓
MonitoringRun
↓
HTTP Evidence Collection
↓
CollectedEvidence
↓
NormalizedEvidence
↓
Finding
↓
Risk
↓
TrustAssessment

## Sprint 1 Completion Notes

Sprint 1 completed the following architecture-aligned implementation areas:

- Website registration baseline
- Monitoring run execution lifecycle
- Real HTTP evidence collection
- Evidence normalization
- Finding generation
- Risk evaluation
- Trust assessment generation
- Traceability across evidence, findings, risks, and trust assessments
- Scanner configuration
- Scanner target safety guardrails
- Dashboard and detail page visibility
- Assessment outcome clarity

## Preserved Architecture Boundaries

- Evidence Collection Engine collects evidence only.
- Evidence Analysis Engine normalizes evidence and produces findings.
- Risk Evaluation Engine produces risks from findings.
- Trust Evaluation Engine produces trust assessments from risks.
- Raw evidence does not directly produce risk or trust decisions.

## Ready for Sprint 2

The project is ready to move to Sprint 2.

Sprint 2 should extend the implemented lifecycle without replacing the Sprint 1 foundation.

# SiteSentinel Architecture Review-2

## Sprint

Sprint 2 Closure

## Result

APPROVED

## Product Owner

Approved

## Architecture Status

Core Assessment Lifecycle Implemented  
Explainable Traceability Layer Implemented

## Implementation Status

Sprint 0 established the approved architecture baseline.

Sprint 1 implemented the first working version of the SiteSentinel core assessment lifecycle.

Sprint 2 implemented the explainable traceability review layer across the persisted assessment lifecycle.

The implemented lifecycle is:

Website

MonitoringRun
↓
HTTP Evidence Collection
↓
CollectedEvidence
↓
NormalizedEvidence
↓
Finding
↓
Risk
↓
TrustAssessment

The implemented traceability review layer exposes:

## Sprint 2 Completion Notes

Sprint 2 completed the following architecture-aligned implementation areas:

- Finding detail traceability
- Normalized evidence detail traceability
- Collected evidence detail traceability
- Risk detail traceability
- Trust assessment detail traceability
- Traceability navigation between lifecycle outputs
- Monitoring run traceability summary dashboard
- Overall traceability QA status
- Coverage status labels for lifecycle traceability paths
- Same-page traceability review anchors

## Preserved Architecture Boundaries

- Evidence Collection Engine collects evidence only.
- Evidence Analysis Engine normalizes evidence and produces findings.
- Risk Evaluation Engine produces risks from findings.
- Trust Evaluation Engine produces trust assessments from risks.
- Traceability views expose persisted relationships only.
- Traceability views do not reinterpret evidence, findings, risks, or trust assessments.
- Raw evidence does not directly produce risk or trust decisions.

## Ready for Sprint 3

The project is ready to move to Sprint 3.

Sprint 3 should extend the implemented lifecycle and traceability foundation without replacing the 
Sprint 1 or Sprint 2 architecture baseline.
