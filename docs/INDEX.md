## Active Sprint

## Completed Sprint

### Sprint 3 — Assessment History & Change Comparison Baseline

Sprint 3 is complete.

Sprint 3 added a read-only comparison layer that compares a completed monitoring run against the previous completed monitoring run for the same website.

The comparison layer answers:

- What changed since the previous completed run?
- Did the trust status change?
- Did the trust score improve, decline, or stay the same?
- Which finding types are new?
- Which finding types are resolved?
- Which finding types are unchanged?
- Which risk types are new?
- Which risk types are resolved?
- Which risk types are unchanged?

Sprint 3 preserved the Sprint 1 lifecycle and Sprint 2 traceability boundaries.

It compares existing persisted lifecycle outputs only.  
It does not create new findings, risks, trust assessments, or evidence.

## Current Baseline

SiteSentinel now has a functional real-scan baseline, an explainable traceability review layer, and a historical 
assessment comparison baseline.

The system can register a public website, execute a real HTTP scan, persist collected evidence, normalize evidence,
generate findings, evaluate risks, produce a trust assessment, expose traceability across the persisted lifecycle, and compare the latest completed assessment against the previous completed assessment for the same website.

## Next Phase

Recommended next scope:

Sprint 4 — Scheduled Monitoring & Recurring Scan Baseline

Sprint 4 should build on the Sprint 3 comparison baseline by introducing controlled scheduled monitoring.

Recommended Sprint 4 candidate blocks:

- Schedule configuration per website.
- Manual enable/disable of scheduled monitoring.
- Safe recurring scan execution.
- Prevention of overlapping monitoring runs.
- Latest scheduled run visibility.
- Scheduled scan failure handling.
- Scheduled monitoring QA and closure documentation.
