## Completed Sprint

### Sprint 4 — Scheduled Monitoring & Recurring Scan Baseline

Sprint 4 is complete.

Sprint 4 introduced controlled scheduled monitoring while preserving the existing lifecycle, traceability, and comparison boundaries.

Sprint 4 added:

- Schedule configuration per website.
- Manual enable and disable controls for scheduled monitoring.
- Safe recurring scan execution.
- Prevention of overlapping monitoring runs for the same website.
- Stale active run recovery.
- Manual versus scheduled run visibility.
- Latest scheduled run visibility.
- Scheduled monitoring QA and closure documentation.

Sprint 4 did not add:

- Notification delivery.
- Report generation.
- CSV export.
- PDF export.
- Custom cron expression support.
- Multi-node scheduler coordination.
- Authentication or user access control.


### Sprint 3 — Assessment History & Change Comparison Baseline

Sprint 3 is complete.

Sprint 3 added a read-only comparison layer that compares a completed monitoring run against the previous completed monitoring run for the same website.

The comparison layer answers:

- What changed since the previous completed run?
- Did the trust status change?
- Did the trust score improve, decline, or stay the same?
- Which finding types are new?
- Which finding types are resolved?
- Which finding types are unchanged?
- Which risk types are new?
- Which risk types are resolved?
- Which risk types are unchanged?

Sprint 3 preserved the Sprint 1 lifecycle and Sprint 2 traceability boundaries.

It compares existing persisted lifecycle outputs only.  
It does not create new findings, risks, trust assessments, or evidence.

## Current Baseline

SiteSentinel now has a functional real-scan baseline, an explainable traceability review layer, a historical 
assessment comparison baseline, a controlled scheduled monitoring baseline, 
a browser-based monitoring run report baseline, and a persisted in-application notification event baseline.

The system can register a public website, execute a real HTTP scan, persist collected evidence, normalize evidence, 
generate findings, evaluate risks, produce a trust assessment, expose traceability across the persisted lifecycle, 
compare completed assessments against previous completed assessments, 
execute recurring scheduled scans through the existing monitoring lifecycle, present monitoring run reports, 
and persist important monitoring outcomes as notification events.

## Next Phase

Recommended next scope:

Sprint 7 — Notification Management Baseline

Sprint 7 should build on the completed notification event baseline by adding in-application notification management.

Recommended Sprint 7 candidate blocks:

- Notification event list page.
- Notification event detail page.
- Notification filtering by severity.
- Notification filtering by status.
- Mark notification as read control.
- Mark notification as unread control.
- Dashboard navigation to notification management.
- Website-level navigation to notification management.
- Notification management QA and sprint closure documentation.

Sprint 7 should not introduce real email, WhatsApp, Slack, or webhook delivery yet.
